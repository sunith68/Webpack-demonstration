## Webpack
This is a simple project to demonstrate Webpack
### Getting Started
To get started install the necessary modules through npm
``` 
npm install
```
### Running Webpack
To bundle the modules run any one of the scripts in package.json using  ` npm run  `    
You can then view your results either in the destination folder or in http://localhost:3000/ depending on the script you run  
You can open the respective html file for your bundle in the public folder to view your web application      
If you are running the 'configf' script then you can open your result in http://localhost:3000/final.html
#### What each script does
``` 
npm run config1
```  
You can view the bundled file in destination and open index1.html to run 
``` 
npm run config1d
``` 
Open http://localhost:3000/ to run  
``` 
npm run config2
``` 
You can view the bundled file in destination and open index2.html to run  
``` 
npm run config3
``` 
You can view the application.html in destination folder  
``` 
npm run configf
``` 
You can view the final result here http://localhost:3000/final.html
